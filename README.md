After watching his father perish in a fatal encounter with the unbeatable opponent known as 'Justice,' a determined young boy named Afro vows to master the art of sword fighting and seek revenge. 
His quest is marked by unrelenting pain and suffering. Driven by an unyielding desire to avenge his father's death, Afro becomes emotionally detached and devoid of compassion. 
His journey takes place in a dystopian world plagued by advanced technology and lawlessness, where he is relentlessly pursued by powerful enemies, constantly dodging bullets and blades. 
Nonetheless, Afro remains steadfast in his pursuit of an immortal adversary, willing to leave a trail of destruction and bloodshed in his wake until he achieves victory.
A special 5-episode tv series for fans of the action. You cannot miss this one.
